This is a readme file. This file will be used to plan out the MathGame and provide a guide to the classes.
Note. I use class but there will not be any "class" objects such as defined in C++. Classes will refer to different files
that use functions.
CLASSES:

    Startup
        ~Displays Welcome Message
        ~Gets Username and stores this in a function in the class for use in other files

    QuestionGenerator
        ~Creates questions using RandomNumber class for random numbers
        ~Stores these in QuestionAnswer class
    QuestionAnswer
        ~Creates a struct object that stores the question and the answer.
        ~Allows the passing of two different data values to different classes
    Question
        ~Prints the question, returns the answer stored in userAnswer
    Checker
        ~Gets Question, Answer, userAnswer
        ~Return boolean true or false
